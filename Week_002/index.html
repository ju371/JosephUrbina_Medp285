    <p> Your <em>eye</em>, first of all, would glide over the <center><h3><strong>grey</strong></h3></center> fitted carpet in the narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor. Its walls would be cupboards, in light-coloured wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, depicting, respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named Ville-de-Motitereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick, <center><h3><strong>black,</strong></h3></center> grainy wooden rings which would slide back at the merest touch. There, the carpet would give way to an almost <center><h3><strong>yellow</strong></h3></center> woodblock floor, partly covered by three faded rugs.<br>
<br>
  It would be a living room about twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide. On the left, in a kind of recess, there would be a large sofa upholstered in worn <center><h3><strong>black</strong></h3></center> leather, with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, heaped with books in untidy piles. Above the sofa, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, there would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, with a <center><h3><strong>light-brown velvet</strong></h3></center> covering; it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in <center><h3><strong>dark red</strong></h3></center> and providing three display shelves for knick-knacks: agates and stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy-boxes, jade ashtrays, a mother-of-pearl oystershell, a <center><h3><strong>silver</strong></h3></center> fob watch, a cut-glass glass, a crystal pyramid, a miniature in an oval frame. Further on, beyond a padded door, there would be shelving on both sides of the corner, for caskets and for records, beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined-steel knobs would be visible, and above it, a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. Through the window, draped with <center><h3><strong>white and brown</strong></h3></center> curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, you would glimpse a few trees, a tiny park, a bit of street. A roll-top desk littered with papers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. On a console table would be a telephone, a leather diary, a writing pad. Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a large, cylindrical vase decorated in <center><h3><strong>blue</strong></h3></center> and filled with <center><h3><strong>yellow</strong></h3></center> roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, there would be a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your <em>eye</em> back to the leather curtain.<br>
  <br>  
        It would be all in:<ol><h3><strong><ul>browns</ul></strong></h3><h3><strong><ul>ochres</ul></strong></h3><h3><strong><ul>duns and yellows:</ul></strong></h3></ol> a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some striking, brighter splashes - a cushion in almost garish <center><h3><strong>orange,</strong></h3></center> a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner, the record shelves, the desk, the low table between the two settees, and the vague reflections in the mirror — and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam - the polished wood, the rich, heavy silks, the cut glass, the softened leather — it would be a haven of peace, a land of happiness.<br>
